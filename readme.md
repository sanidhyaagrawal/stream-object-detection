## Overview

***An application that uses pre-trained PyTorch model to perform object detection in real-time where the video feed is acquired from webcam, packaged using docker and prepared for deployment on Kubernetes***

The whole process is completes in 2 steps:
1. Frames are received from the webcam.
2. The frames are processed using the pre-trained model ([yolov5s](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases))
3. If person is detected with confidence greater than 0.5, we consider it as anomaly and send a notification.

The main files and folders in the directory are:
1. webcam
    - ðŸ“‘ app.py - contains the APIs.
    - ðŸ“‘ Dockerfile - used for building the docker image.
    - ðŸ“‘ requirements.txt - used for installing the dependencies.
2. live_stream
    - ðŸ“‘ client.py - Client side code to stream the video feed from webcam to the server.
    - ðŸ“‘ server.py - Server side code to process the frames and send the anomaly notifications.
    - ðŸ“‘ Dockerfile - used for building the docker image.
    - ðŸ“‘ requirements.txt - used for installing the dependencies.

## Installation
- The Docker image can be built using the following command:
    
    ```
    docker build -t sanidhya7921/stream-object-detection .
    ```

- To test your Docker image locally.:

    ```
    docker run sanidhya7921/stream-object-detection     
    ```
> â„¹ : to push your Docker image to Docker Hub, use the following command- <br>
`docker push sanidhya7921/stream-object-detection`
